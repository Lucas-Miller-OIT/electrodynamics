    "# Dipole Radiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Any accelerating charge produces electromagnetic radiation.  If the charges in a neutral object — like an atom or a radio antenna — are undergoing periodic motion, we can approximate the system as an **oscillating electric dipole**.  As discussed in Chapter 9 of _CER_ or [Chapter 28 of the Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_28.html), the __radiation field__ at point $\\vec{r}$ in the $xz$-plane far from a dipole oscillating along the $z$-axis at the origin is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\n",
    "\\, \\omega^2 p_0 \\sin \\theta\n",
    "\\, \\dfrac{\\cos \\omega(t - r/c)}{r}\n",
    "\\, (\\hat{e}_x \\cos \\theta - \\hat{e}_z \\sin \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to tame this expression and create a movie of an oscillating electric field.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| $\\omega$ | angular frequency of oscillation |\n",
    "| $p_0$ | maximum dipole moment |\n",
    "| $c$ | speed of light |\n",
    "| $r$ | distance from origin to point of interest |\n",
    "| $t$ | current time |\n",
    "| $\\theta$ | angle from $y$-axis to point of interest |\n",
    "\n",
    "The final term in parentheses is a unit vector that gives the direction of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warm Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to watch the electromagnetic waves propagate outward from the dipole as it oscillates.  This means we need to choose the time increments and spatial grid of points appropriately.  We need to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the duration of the simulation if we want to watch 10 complete cycles of oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine the size of the grid if we want to see at least 5 wavelengths in each direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine a reasonable time increment `dt` and grid spacing `dx` for simulating red light with a wavelength of $700 \\ {\\tt nm}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have the computer hardware of lifespan to simulate a 1 billion by 1 billion grid of points for 10 billion time steps!\n",
    "\n",
    "___Solution:___\n",
    "\n",
    "- The wavelength of the light is $\\lambda = 7.0 \\, 10^{-7} \\ {\\tt m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The period of a wave is $T = \\dfrac{1}{f} = \\dfrac{\\lambda}{c}$.  For red light, this works out to $T \\approx 2.335 \\cdot 10^{-15} \\ {\\tt s}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Dimensional Analysis:___\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are very small, and the frequency and speed of light are very large. We might run into roundoff error if we are not careful.  Instead, let's choose our units so that numerical values are on the order of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that we can rewrite the argument of the cosine function as follows:\n",
    "$$\\omega(t - R/c) = 2\\pi \\left(\\dfrac{t}{T} - \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n",
    "If we measure time in femtoseconds and distance in micrometers, all numbers in this expression will be of order 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can now rewrite the expression for the electric field as follows:\n",
    "$$\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t)\n",
    "= E_0 \\, \\dfrac{\\lambda}{r} \\, \\cos 2\\pi \\left( \\dfrac{t}{T} - \\dfrac{r}{\\lambda}\\right)\n",
    "\\, (\\hat{e}_x \\cos \\theta - \\hat{e}_z \\sin \\theta)  \\sin \\theta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$E_0 = \\dfrac{\\omega^2 p_0}{\\lambda c^2} = 4 \\pi^2 \\dfrac{p_0}{\\lambda^3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Different values of $E_0$ change the overall magnitude of the electric field, but not the relative size of the components at different points.  Thus, we can set $E_0 = 1$ during the calculation, and we can restore the units if we need to compute forces at another time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of dimensional analysis can greatly simplify codiing and often leads to more accurate results because you do not \"forget\" a factor $10^9$ somewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make a movie!"

For example, modeling an oscillating dipole instead of an accelerating charge and breaking down the timescale to numerical values are on the order of one. As a novice coder, this type of analysis seems incredibly useful to speed up processing and computation. \n",
